(ISO: Bh\u0101rat\nGa\u1e47 ar\u0101jya),[21] is a country in South Asia. It is the\nseventh-largest country by area; the most popul ous country\nas of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its\nindependence in 1947, the world's most popul ous\ndemocracy.[24][25][26] Bounde d by the Indian Ocean on the\nsouth, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of\nBengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with\nPakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the\nnorth; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the\nIndian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the\nMaldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a\nmaritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indone sia.\nModern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from\nAfrica no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29] Their long\noccupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-\ngatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only\nto Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life\nemerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the\nIndus  river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into\nthe Indus  Valley Civilisation of the third millennium\nBCE.[31] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an\nIndo-European langua ge, had diffused into India from the\nnorthwest.[32][33] Its evidence today is found in the hymns\nof the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was\nresolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of\nHinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian langua ges of India\nwere supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\nBy 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had\nemerged within Hinduism,[36] and Buddhi sm and Jainism\nhad arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to\nheredity.[37] Early political consolidations gave rise to the\nloose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges\nBasin.[38] Their collective era was suffused with wide-\nranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining\nstatus of women,[40] and the incorporation of\nuntouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][41] In\nSouth India, the Middle kingdom s exported Dravidian-\nlangua ges scripts and religious cultures to the kingdom s of\nSoutheast Asia.[42][1]\n[4][2]\n0:000:00\n/ 0:00/ 0:00\n[b][1][2]\n0:000:00\n/ 0:00/ 0:00\nTerritory controlled by India shown in dark\ngreen; territory claimed but not controlled\nshown in light green", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2734, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdb20ec0-363d-448e-9af3-9f424482d271": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdb20ec0-363d-448e-9af3-9f424482d271", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "191d6244-6984-4d18-9978-5f3dae4de721", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "hash": "b8ef2da6ad4c616491283ede7f1de76d9a611a5cba1b891404212caf96dc9d02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Delhi (metropolitan\narea)\nOfficial languagesHindi \u00b7 English[d][8]\nRecognised\nregional languagesState level and\nEighth Schedule[9]\n8th Scheduled\nAssamese \u00b7 Bengali\n\u00b7 Boro \u00b7 Dogri \u00b7\nGujarati \u00b7 Hindi \u00b7\nKannada \u00b7 Kashmiri\n\u00b7 Konkani \u00b7 Maithili \u00b7\nMalayalam \u00b7\nManipuri \u00b7 Marathi \u00b7\nNepali \u00b7 Odia \u00b7\nPunjabi \u00b7 Sanskrit \u00b7\nSantali \u00b7 Sindhi \u00b7\nTamil \u00b7 Telugu \u00b7\nUrdu\nState level[e]\nKokborok \u00b7 Lepcha \u00b7\nMizo \u00b7 Sikkimese \u00b7\nall the 8th\nscheduled\nlanguages (except\nSindhi, Kashmiri\nand Dogri[f])\nNative languages 447 languages[g]\nReligion (2011) 79.8% Hinduism\n14.2% Islam\n2.3% Christianity\n1.7% Sikhism\n0.7% Buddhism\n0.4% Jainism\n0.23% unaffiliated\n0.65% other[12]\nDemonym(s) Indian \u00b7 others\nGovernment Federal\nparliamentary\nrepublic\n\u2022 President Droupadi Murmu\n\u2022 Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar\n\u2022 Prime Minister Narendra Modi\n\u2022 Chief Justice Dhananjaya Y.\nChandrachud\nLegislature Parliament\n\u2022 Upper house Rajya Sabha\n\u2022 Lower house Lok Sabha\nIndependence from the United KingdomIn the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and\nZoroastrianism became established on India's southern and\nwestern coasts.[43] Muslim armies from Central Asia\nintermittently overran India's northern plains,[44] eventually\nfoundi ng the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India\ninto the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45] In\nthe 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-\nlasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46] In the\nPunjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised\nreligion.[47] The Mugha l Empire, in 1526, ushered in two\ncenturies of relative peace,[48] leaving a legacy of luminous\narchitecture.[l][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British\nEast India Company followed, turning India into a colonial\neconom y, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British\nCrown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians\nwere granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes\nwere introduc ed, and modern ideas of education and the\npublic life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential\nnationalist movement emerged, which was noted for\nnonvi olent resistance and became the major factor in\nending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian\nEmpire was partitioned into two independent\ndominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of\nIndia and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid\nlarge-scale loss of life and an unpr ecedented migration.[60]\nIndia has been a federal republic since 1950, gove rned\nthrough a democratic parliamentary system. It is a\npluralistic, multilingua l and multi-ethnic society. India's\npopul ation grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost\n1.4 billion in 2022.[61] During the same time, its nominal\nper capita income increased from US$64 annua lly to\nUS$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6%  to 74%.

Jainism came into prominence\nduring the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[94] Buddhi sm, based on\nthe teachings of Gautama Buddha , attracted followers from all\nsocial classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the\nBuddha  was central to the beginnings of recorded history in\nIndia.[95][96][97] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both\nreligions held up renunc iation as an ideal,[98] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions.\nPolitically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom  of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to\nemerge as the Mauryan Empire.[99] The empire was once thought  to have controlled most of the\nsubcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought  to have been separated by large\nautonom ous areas.[100][101] The Mauryan kings are know n as much for their empire-building and\ndetermined management of public life as for Ashoka 's renunc iation of militarism and far-flung advoc acy of\nthe Buddhi st dham ma.[102][103]\nThe Sangam literature of the Tamil langua ge reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern\npeninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandya s, dyna sties that traded extensively with the\nRoman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[104][105] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal\ncontrol within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[106][99] By the 4th and 5th\ncenturies, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater\nGanges Plain;

Although at first disruptive for the Indian\nelites, the sultanate largely left its vast non- Muslim subject popul ation to its own laws and customs.[117][118]\nBy repeatedly repulsing Mongol  raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation\nvisited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned\nmen, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic\nIndo-Islamic culture in the north.[119][120] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdom sMedieval India", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3376, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5cd226a-bfe4-41d8-ac82-f359b5d944db": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5cd226a-bfe4-41d8-ac82-f359b5d944db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8dfc3244-4f73-4761-9caa-3a2787be6fab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "hash": "19abf8fbc2b9a09de55b5aa4b9453a478b2213540467686aadb106b77e3234c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A distant view of the Taj\nMahal from the Agra Fort\nA two mohur Company gold coin,\nissued in 1835, the obverse\ninscribed \"William IV, King\"of South India paved the way for the indigenous  Vijayanagara Empire.[121] Embracing a strong Shaivite\ntradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of\npeninsular India,[122] and w as to influence South Indian society for long a fterwards.[121]\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then unde r mainly Muslim rulers,[123] fell again to the superior\nmobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124] The resulting Mugha l Empire\ndid not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new\nadministrative practices[125][126] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[127] leading to more systematic,\ncentralised, and uniform rule.[128] Eschewing tribal bonds  and Islamic identity, especially unde r Akbar, the\nMugha ls united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an\nemperor who had near-divine status.[127] The Mugha l state's econom ic policies, deriving most revenues\nfrom agriculture[129] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[130] caused\npeasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much\nof the 17th century was a factor in India's econom ic expansion,[128] resulting in greater patronage of\npainting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[131] Newly coherent social groups  in northern and\nwestern India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and gove rning ambitions\nduring Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military\nexperience.[132] Expanding commerce during Mugha l rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political\nelites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[132] As the empire disintegrated, many among these\nelites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[133]\nBy the early 18th century, with the lines\nbetween commercial and political dominance\nbeing increasingly blurred, a number of\nEuropean trading companies, including the\nEnglish East India Company, had established\ncoastal outposts.[134][135] The East India\nCompany's control of the seas, greater\nresources, and more advanced military training\nand technology led it to increasingly assert its\nmilitary strength and caused it to become\nattractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control\nover the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[136][134][137][138] Its further\naccess to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex\nor subdue  most of India by the 1820s .[139] India was then no longe r exporting manufactured goods  as it\nlong had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to\nbe the onset of India's colonial period.[134] By this time, with its econom ic power severely curtailed by the\nBritish parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India\nCompany began more consciously to enter non-econom ic arenas, including education, social reform, and\nculture.[140]Early modern India\nModern India", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3421, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0622fa16-8470-4e3c-b5c8-6b450337130c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0622fa16-8470-4e3c-b5c8-6b450337130c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f0b2c4c-f458-4cf2-91c8-8823819b051b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "hash": "7f12956d494a47ac5acd08cbfe344e555bc80948d85c632c90f2a1702885fbd3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1909 map of the British\nIndian Empire\nJawaharlal Nehru sharing a\nlight moment with Mahatma\nGandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment\nin 1848 of Lord Dalhous ie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes\nessential to a modern state.

Technological changes\u2014among them,\nrailways, canals, and the telegraph\u2014were introduc ed not long after their introduc tion in\nEurope.[141][142][143][144] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off\nthe Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style\nsocial reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landow ners and princes, the rebellion\nrocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the founda tions of Company rule.[145][146]\nAlthough the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the\ndirect administration of India by the British gove rnment. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but\nlimited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a\nfeudal safeguard against future unrest.[147][148] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all\nover India, leading eventually to the foundi ng of  the Indian National Congress in 1885.[149][150][151][152]\nThe rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was\nmarked by econom ic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away\nmarkets.[153] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[154] and, despite the risks of\ninfrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for\nIndians.[155] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled\nPunjab, led to increased food produc tion for internal consumption.[156] The railway network provided\ncritical famine relief,[157] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[157] and helped nascent Indian-owned\nindustry.[156]\nAfter World War I, in which approximately\none million Indians served,[158] a new period\nbegan. It was marked by British reforms but\nalso repressive legislation, by more strident\nIndian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings\nof a nonvi olent movement of non-co-\noperation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would\nbecome the leader and enduring symbol.[159]\nDuring the 1930s , slow legislative reform was\nenacted by the British; the Indian National\nCongress won victories in the resulting\nelections.[160] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's\nfinal push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of\nindependence in 1947, but  tempered by t he partition of  India into two states: India and Pakistan.[161]\nVital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in\nplace a secular and democratic republic.[162] Per the London Declaration, India retained its membership of\nthe Commonwealth, becoming the first republic within it.[163] Econom ic liberalisation, which began in the\n1980s  and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical know -how,[164] has created a large urban\nmiddle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing econom ies,[165] and increased its\ngeopolitical clout.

To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the\nAravallis.[175][176][177]\nThe remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India, the oldest\nand geologically most stable part of India.

The Congress was voted out  again in 1989  when a National Front coalition, led by t he newly\nformed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that gove rnment too proved relatively\nshort-lived, lasting just unde r two years. There were two prime ministers during this period; V.P. Singh and\nChandra Shekhar.[235] Elections were held again in 1991 ; no party won an absolute majority. The\nCongress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority government led by P. V. Narasimha\nRao.[236]\nA two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election\nof 1996 . Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The\nBJP formed a gove rnment briefly in 1996; it was followed by two\ncomparatively long-lasting United Front coalitions, which depended\non external suppor t. There were two prime ministers during this\nperiod; H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In 1998 , the BJP was\nable to form a successful coalition, the National Democratic Alliance\n(NDA).

Hindu and Jain\nsites appear rather later.[394][395] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the\nprevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors\nprobably usually served all communities.[396] Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE \u2013 c. 500 CE, is often regarded\nas a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of Hindu\nsculpture, as at the Elephanta Caves.[397][398] Across the north, this became rather stiff and formulaic after\nc. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds  of statues.[399] But in the South, under the\nPallava and Chola dyna sties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of great\nachievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of India.[400][401]\nAncient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta\nCaves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly\naccomplishment in Gupta times.[402][403] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India\nabout the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhi st and later Jain. No doubt  the style of\nthese was used in larger paintings.[404] The Persian-derived Deccan painting, starting just before the\nMugha l miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits,\nand the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[405][406] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially\namong the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innova tive,\nwith figures such as Nih\u00e2l Chand and Nainsukh.[407][408] As a market developed among European\nresidents, it was supplied by Company painting by Indian artists with considerable WesternVisual art", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3969, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ecb6f3d-6be1-4ef8-bbde-56c573e15eb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ecb6f3d-6be1-4ef8-bbde-56c573e15eb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e16b437-f7e7-45ce-85e5-4e5565e393a3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "hash": "f2d0d639cd61deaeec490d5097093e9201603e36f47571aa18f0e9e338c3f016", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "influence.[409][410] In the 19th century, cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done  on paper,\nwere urban folk art from Calcutta, which later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges\nfounde d by t he British, the first movement in modern Indian painting.[411][412]", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 296, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a46847c4-2c9d-447b-974a-dfb39a0262d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a46847c4-2c9d-447b-974a-dfb39a0262d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e06b8d1-9159-4c0e-b9a5-964532df8f29", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "hash": "dca699d625f34b339c00549c6956f18be977cc682bef580c9b269f0263838352", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Bhutesvara Yakshis, Buddhist\nreliefs from Mathura, 2nd\ncentury CE \nGupta terracotta relief,\nKrishna Killing the\nHorse Demon Keshi,\n5th century\nElephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva,\n18 feet (5.5 m) tall, c. 550 \nChola bronze of Shiva as\nNataraja (\"Lord of\nDance\"), Tamil Nadu, 10th\nor 11th century \nJahangir Receives\nPrince Khurram at\nAjmer on His Return\nfrom the Mewar\nCampaign,\nBalchand, c. 1635\nKrishna Fluting to the Milkmaids, Kangra\npainting, 1775\u20131785\nArchitecture", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5e88bcf-f431-4332-850d-6a97e5f1b6ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5e88bcf-f431-4332-850d-6a97e5f1b6ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "44301bbd-ed10-44bf-bc55-8c734fcf5a8c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "India.pdf"}, "hash": "725282d871d89d7950e90660e4123a3a5008f7da81e0d68073b426213701a63e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna\nriver showing two outlying red\nsandstone buildings, a mosque on the\nright (west) and a jawab (response)\nthought to have been built for\narchitectural balanceMuch of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal, other\nworks of Indo-Islamic Mugha l architecture, and South Indian\narchitecture, blends ancient local traditions with imported\nstyles.[413] Vernacular architecture is also regional in its\nflavours.

This period was characterised by a\nvaried and wide spectrum of thought  and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works\ndiffered significantly from classical traditions.[428] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in\nsocial questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the\nworks of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,[429] who was a recipient of the\nNobel Prize in Literature.\nIndian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. Classical music encompasses two genres\nand their various folk offshoots: the northern Hindus tani and the southern Carnatic schools.[430]\nRegionalised popul ar forms include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-\nknow n form of the latter. Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-\nknow n folk dances are: bhangr a of Punjab, bihu of Assam, Jhumair and chhau  of Jharkhand, Odisha and\nWest Bengal, garba and dandi ya of Gujarat, ghoom ar of Rajasthan, and lavani of Maharashtra. Eight\ndance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance\nstatus by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama.
