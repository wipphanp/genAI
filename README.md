# AI Agents Based Data Access Application

## Overview

This application leverages AI agents to access and extract information from various data sources. The agents are built using `llama index` and `gpt-3.5-turbo`. The project includes two specialized agents:

1. **PDF Agent**: Reads and extracts information from PDF files.
2. **Tabular Data Agent**: Accesses and extracts information from tabular datasets (e.g., CSV files).

The AI agents determine the most appropriate data source based on the query and provide the relevant information. Additionally, the agents can save the extracted information to a notepad file if instructed.

## Features

- AI-powered data extraction from PDF and CSV files.
- Intelligent selection of data source based on query.
- Save extracted information to a notepad file.

## Installation

To set up the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-data-access.git
    cd ai-data-access
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Running the Application**:

    Execute the main script to start the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Querying the AI Agents**:

    - You can ask questions related to the population of countries or information about India.
    - Based on your query, the appropriate agent will be activated to fetch the information.

3. **Saving Information**:

    - If you want to save the extracted information, specify this in your query.
    - The information will be saved to a notepad file.
